## Call for contributions

We solicit submission of **original research** at the interface between optimal transport theory, statistics, optimization, machine learning and applications.
Authors can submit work that overlaps with previously published or submitted work, as long as it adds a new perspective on that work.
Selected submissions will be presented in spotlight talks.

### Important dates

- submission deadline: Friday, 17 September 2021
- author notification: Friday, 15 October 2021

### Submission website

The submissions must be done using [using the easychair website](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=otml2021).

### Scope and topics

Topics of interest to the workshop broadly include

##### Estimation of Optimal Transport Couplings and Maps

- Resolution of the Kantorovich problem and its variants (semi-discrete, continuous) at large scales
- Estimation of Monge maps between measures using parameterized or constrained families of potentials
- Estimation of Monge maps across time using JKO formulations.

##### Generalizations of OT

- Unbalanced formulations: OT between measures of different total mass
- Quadratic formulations of the OT problem, Gromov-Wasserstein metrics. OT with rigid transformations.
- Multi-marginal formulations for OT
- Quantum OT
- Martingale OT and time constraints in the estimation of OT

##### OT as a learning methodology

- Optimal transport costs as a loss: GAN type results, minimization of Wasserstein distances between parameterized measures and data measures.
- Optimal transport to define data transformations: domain adaptation, clustering, incorporation into MCMC methods.
- Learning of ground metrics and costs, OT carried out on projections (sliced and higher dimensional)

##### Statistics and Theory

- Interplay between OT and statistics: properties of finite sample OT estimators between continuous measures, either seen as Monge maps or couplings.
- OT as a criterion to study the convergence of sampling methods.
- OT as a tool to define convexity, sorting and quantiles
- Study of the complexity of OT algorithms such as the Sinkhorn iteration and variants.

##### OT in applications

- High-dimensional applications: Natural Language / Word Embeddings, Biology, Vision, etc...
- Low-dimensional applications: Graphics, shapes, imaging, univariate measures, etc...



### Style
Authors should use [the standard Neurips 2021 style files](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2021/PaperInformation/StyleFiles).
The recommended length for submissions is between 6 and 9 pages.
All submissions must be processed using [the easychair website set up for this workshop](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=otml2021).
We guarantee that all works submitted before September 17, 2021  (23:59 PDT) will be given full consideration and will be reviewed by at least three reviewers. Late submissions might be considered as well.


### Fellowships

We provide fellowships which cover workshop registration. Details **to be released**.
